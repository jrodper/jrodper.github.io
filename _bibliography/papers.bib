  abstract={This work describes, from basic principles, how to build and operate a radio telescope for detecting the neutral hydrogen line at 21 cm. It covers the design and construction of the antenna, the operation of the electronics, and the subsequent data processing. Finally, it presents the spectra obtained through the described process.},

  author={Rodr{\'\i}guez P{\'e}rez, Jorge and others},
  annotation={Degree final project with Philippe Thiery Giménez as advisor.},
  year={2024},
  abstract={This work focuses on providing an updated theoretical framework for Clebsch’s calculation, addressing limit cases and formalizing the symbolic method used by Clebsch and Salmon. The symbolic method is formalized using multilinear algebra, properties of determinants in rings are reviewed, and concepts of algebraic geometry are introduced to study inflection points. Finally, a rigorous proof of Clebsch’s calculation is presented to obtain a closed expression for Salmon’s polynomial.},
